# Fractional-dynamics-foster-deep-learning-of-COPDstage-prediction
"k_fold_validation" and "hold_out_validation" folders contain the deep-learning code for predicting early COPD stages (the results are confirmed with k-fold (k=5) cross-validation and hold-out validation)

Please use this link to download our dataset (matrix A) to execute our code: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bSsQnvEm8DFJVicxSlkdPCwLciq2PE4v?usp=sharing

The code package is available in Python. Run code in Google Colab is recommended.

"Fractional dynamic modeling" folder contains the code to extract the fractional signatures from time-series. 

We provide an example edf file extracted from a patient with mild symptoms (stage 1). Please use this link to download the file: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15VuS5EbrmnktFh9dsAX1NRQX-t-eGzV_?usp=sharing

The code package is written in matlab.
